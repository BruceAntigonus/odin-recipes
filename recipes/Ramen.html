    <p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle 
        soup dish that consists of
        Chinese-style wheat noodles
        served in a rich broth. The
        broth can vary—ranging from
        soy sauce-based (shoyu), miso-based,
        or pork-based (tonkotsu)—and is often
        flavored with ingredients like garlic,
        ginger, and soy sauce. Ramen is usually
        topped with slices of pork, soft-boiled eggs,
        nori (seaweed), and green onions.</p>

        <li>4 packs ramen noodles (wheat-based)</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken, pork, or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 tbsp miso paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 inch ginger, minced</li>
        <li>4 slices pork belly or chicken (optional)</li>
        <li>4 soft-boiled eggs</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori (seaweed)</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mushrooms (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup bamboo shoots (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sesame oil (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili oil (optional)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
        <li>Cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a pot, heat the broth over medium heat. Add soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. Stir well and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the miso paste with a ladle of the hot broth, then stir the mixture back into the pot. Be sure the broth doesn't boil once the miso is added to avoid bitterness.</li>
        <li>Prepare the soft-boiled eggs by boiling them for 6 minutes. Remove and place in ice water, then peel.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, cook the pork belly or chicken slices until browned and set aside.</li>
        <li>Divide the cooked ramen noodles into bowls. Pour the hot miso broth over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Top each bowl with slices of pork belly or chicken, soft-boiled egg halves, nori sheets, green onions, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with sesame oil and chili oil (optional) for an extra layer of flavor.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
