    <p>A brownie is a classic American
    dessert that is rich, chocolatey, and
    dense. It's made from a mixture of
    melted chocolate or cocoa powder,
    butter, sugar, eggs, and flour,
    often with the addition of ingredients
    like nuts or chocolate chips.</p>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup (115g) butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup brown sugar (optional)</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (or 1 cup melted dark chocolate)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp baking powder (optional, for a cakey texture)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup nuts (optional, e.g., walnuts or pecans)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line an 8x8 inch (20x20 cm) baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar (if using). Mix until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder (or melted chocolate), baking powder (if using), and salt.</li>
    <li>Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
    <li>If desired, fold in chocolate chips and/or nuts for extra texture.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread evenly.</li>
    <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. For fudgier brownies, bake for less time.</li>
    <li>Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares and serving.</li>
</ol>
