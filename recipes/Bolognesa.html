    <p>Bolognese is a classic Italian meat
        sauce that originates from the city 
        of Bologna. Itâ€™s traditionally made
        with ground beef or a mix of beef 
        and pork</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (or mix of beef and pork)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 carrots, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 celery stalks, finely chopped</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes (or 2 tbsp tomato paste)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk (optional)</li>
    <li>1 cup beef or chicken stock</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>Fresh basil (optional, for garnish)</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)</li>
    <li>Pasta (e.g., tagliatelle or spaghetti)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, carrots, and celery. Cook until the vegetables are soft, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat if needed.</li>
    <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes (or tomato paste), red wine (if using), and beef or chicken stock. Season with salt, pepper, and oregano.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat and simmer uncovered for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. For richer flavor, simmer for 1-2 hours, adding more stock or water if needed.</li>
    <li>Stir in the milk at the end (if using) for extra creaminess. Adjust seasoning.</li>
    <li>Cook the pasta according to package instructions. Drain and toss with the Bolognese sauce.</li>
    <li>Serve with fresh basil and grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
</ol>
